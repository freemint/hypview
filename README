Attention:

This directory now contains the MASTER resource files
(previously they were created by a MultiLayer Resource
in the parent directory). Also, definition files have been
changed to use *.rso format. If you absolutely need to
edit the files with some other editor, then:
- use ORCS to create definition files for it (all known
  formats are supported, even *.rsm)
- Edit the file
- DELETE the *.rso file. This is important, because if
  you use eg. InterFace to edit the resource, it will
  not care about the *.rso file, and only update the
  *.hrd file. ORCS will then load the (old) rso file,
  which does not match anymore.
- Run ORCS again, and recreate the *.rso file by just saving
  the file


Also, since the various languages are now in separate resource
files, don't forget to update the other two if you made structural
changes (change object types, reorder items etc.)

The hyp_view.rsc in the parent directory should be a copy
of the en.rsc from here.
